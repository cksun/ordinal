This file documents updates and changes in package ordinal since version
2010.03-04

March 04 2010:

- First version of the package is created.

2010-04-06:

- removing class "clm.fit" from results of finalizeRho.
- moving offset computations from logLik and gradient funtions to
  newRho function.
- Bug fixed in grad.lambda
- checks and warning messages added to profile.clm
- a warning is now given if the profile fits do not converge
- profile.clm has grown the argument 'stepWarn', which gives a
  warning if the no. profile steps in each direction (up or down) is
  less than stepWarn (default 8), which indicates that the profile is
  unreliable.
- Bug in loglog-link for clmm fits fixed.
- Missing values are handled better in clm and clmm.
- clmm has grown an argument 'sdFixed' which assigns a fixed value of
  the standard deviation of the random effects. Optimization is
  performed with respect to the remaining parameters.
- profile.clmm, confint.profile.clmm and plot.profile.clmm are now
  available. Profiling is restricted to the standard deviation
  parameter of the random effects.
- control.clm and control.clmm now handles the control parameters.
